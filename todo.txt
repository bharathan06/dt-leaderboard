done - make sure that if the user already exists then throw an error 
done - fetch users endpoint in server.js 
done - display all users in table
done - display the leaderboard in the table with position (use ranked functions)

- add column total solved which gets updated every time the page is refreshed :
    - you dont need an additional solved probs 
    - instead just find refreshed solved probs by using the most recent monday unix time
        size(submissionCalendar[prev_mon] - submissionCalendar[last element])  
        find the first problem solved right after prev monday unix time, store it as prev_mon_first 
        size(prev_mon_first - most recent element will give us the number of problems solved this week.)
        no need to store this value, but the key here is to store the prev_mon_first problem
        this logic should execute everytime when the user loads the page

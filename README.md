## üìã RULES & INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Entry Commitment**: Once you join the leaderboard, you are committed for the entire cycle; you cannot leave mid-week.
2. **Weekly Timer Reset**: Every Monday at 12:00 AM (midnight), the problem count for all users resets to zero.
3. **Scoring & Winners**:
   - At the end of each week (after the Monday reset), the top three contributors are recognized in the **Winners** section.
   - Positions are determined purely by the number of problems solved within the week.
4. **Prizes & Incentives**: Currently, there are no material rewards‚Äîthis is an initial phase. Future gamification and incentives may be introduced based on community feedback.
